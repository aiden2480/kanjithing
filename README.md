# :u5408: kanjithing
A google chrome extension for practising kanji

## :gear: Installation
1. [Download the repository as a zip](https://github.com/aiden2480/kanjithing/zipball/main) and extract
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Ensure that the `Developer mode` switch is enabled in the top right of your screen
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left corner of the screen
5. Select the folder containing the extension in the popup modal

## :recycle: Update
I haven't yet bothered to make the extension automatically update, so the easiest way to keep the extension up to date
is to `git clone` this repository rather than download the zip file and you can just run `git pull origin master` yourself.
You'll need to go back into the [chrome extension settings](chrome://extensions) and press the refresh icon next to the extension to reload.

## :open_book: How to use
At the moment the only thing you can really do is trace a singular kanji. It's really not that hard to figure out.

## :memo: Future features
- [ ] Make the user guess readings of kanji in words
- [ ] Scoreboard somehow
- [ ] Fix dependency on RapidAPI
- [ ] Update indicator
- [ ] Select a kanji grade to learn or a wakatta unit
- [ ] Offline cache/compatability
    * might not be possible with the small amount of storage space allowed to chrome extensions
