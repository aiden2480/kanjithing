## :shrug: A google chrome extension for practising kanji
You can practise drawing kanji featured in the Wakatta units. It also has other useful information like character readings and example words. 
> [Install on the google chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kanjithing/nccfelhkfpbnefflolffkclhenplhiab)

## :gear: Installation
> The extension is available in the [google chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nccfelhkfpbnefflolffkclhenplhiab), though it can be installed from source with the following instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/aiden2480/kanjithing`
2. Navigate to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions)
3. Ensure that the `Developer mode` switch is enabled in the top right of your screen
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left corner of the screen
5. Select the folder containing the extension in the popup modal

## :recycle: Update
Google chrome will automatically update the extension as I publish new updates if you install from the chrome store.
If installing from this repository, run `git pull origin main`, then go back to `chrome://extensions` and press the refresh icon next to the extension to reload.

I'm using a [custom GitHub action](.github/workflows/updatewebstore.yml) to automatically publish new versions of the extension to the chrome store every time I change the `version` parameter in the `manifest.json` file.
